# Approx-Computing-
This repository consists of the work I did under Prof. Joycee M. mekie. 
We studied a set of approx compressor designs and used them for some error-tolerant applications (image processing and computer vision techniques)
i.e. Gaussian blur, edge detection and JPEG compression
I have studied and made an 8x8 Dadda multiplier for all the compressor designs.
